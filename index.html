      <p>Have you ever wanted to aesthetically group together multiple elements on a page? Have you ever wanted to look classy while you do it? Now you can!</p>
      
      <p>This curly brace uses radial gradient background images to create the "v" at the center of the element, and then :before and :after pseudo selectors to create the branches.</p>
      
      <p>Try resizing the window to see how the brace will resize with it! The best part is that it only requires one element, and it doesn't interfere with any text you place inside. Personally, I like to use it for the &lt;hr&gt; element.</p>
